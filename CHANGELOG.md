# Changelog

## 2.0.0
  * Build and write schema messages [#40](https://github.com/singer-io/tap-mongodb/pull/40) The main changes are:
    1. date-time fields will have a `"type": "string", "format": "date-time"` schema that will cause them to get loaded as date-times instead of strings
    2. decimal fields will have a `"type": "number", "multipleOf": 1e-34` schema written
    3. double fields will have a `"type": "number"` schema written that should prevent them from splitting between doubles/decimals depending on the precision
